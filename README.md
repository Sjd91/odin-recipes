# odin-recipes

This will be my first webpage built following the Odin Project's guidelines. I will try to commit as a pro starting from this project. 

The project itself will be a basic recipe site first built only using HTML, then decorated and styled with CSS. 
Possibly added functionality with JavaScript as well, but we'll see.
